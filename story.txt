Title: The Galactic Adventure


Dear Nithya,

I am writing to you from a futuristic spaceship in a distant galaxy. I found myself here one day after
going for a ride on a white rocket in August. There are 9 planets and stars of various colors here! In the
spaceship there is a pool full of liquid chocolate. I fall asleep each night on a [12] bed of
[13] and dream of [14] [15]. It feels as though I have lived here for
gazillion centuries. I hope one day you can visit, although the only way to get here now is
teleportation on a lightning-fast spaceship!!

Best wishes,
Sai Harsha.
