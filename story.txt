Title: The Galactic Adventure

Dear [1],

I am writing to you from a [2] spaceship in a [3] galaxy. I found myself here one day after
going for a ride on a [4] rocket in [5]. There are 9 planets and stars of various colors here! In the
spaceship there is a pool full of liquid chocolate. I fall asleep each night on a [12] bed of
[13] and dream of [14] [15]. It feels as though I have lived here for
gazillion centuries. I hope one day you can visit, although the only way to get here now is
teleportation on a lightning-fast spaceship!!

Best wishes,
Sai Harsha.
